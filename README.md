# ⚽️ Ballon D'or Predictor: 2025-2026 Season Analysis

A year-long data science project tracking a top-flight football (soccer) club's full season — including domestic league matches, UEFA Champions League, and international performances — to predict potential Ballon d'Or contenders. All data is self-collected and analyzed using Python, spreadsheets, and data visualization tools.

## 📌 Project Overiew

This project is designed to simulate the role of a professional football data analyst. The primary goal is to:

- Track player and team performance throughout the 2025–2026 season
- Identify the most consistent and impactful players month-to-month
- Evaluate players' club + international performance ahead of the 2026 World Cup
- Predict who is most likely to be nominated or win the Ballon d'Or based on performance metrics

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Google Sheets** (for manual stat collection)
- **Git + GitHub** (version control + project tracking)
- **Notion** (project documentation & journal)

## 📝 Current Status

- Notion Project tracker created
- Club selection: Manchester City
- Created Git repo
- Create and populate roster spreadsheet using Google Sheets
- Perform early analysis on current roster for practice and prep for season
- Actively collecting match data starting August 16
- Monthly reports to begin after August matches

## 🔍 Key Questions I'm Exploring

- If a player does exceptionally well in the World Cup, does it really matter if a player was in good form during their domestic and Europe league in order to rank high on the Ballon D’or?

- Which player has the most consistent influence on match outcomes?

- Based on historical data, did previous Ballon D’or winners perform well in the World Cup during that specific year. If not, what other factors determined their ranking?

- How much does international form during a World Cup Season influence the Ballon D'or ranking?
